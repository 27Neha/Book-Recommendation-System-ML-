# 📚Book-Recommendation-System-ML-
This project is a Book Recommendation System that suggests books to users based on their preferences using collaborative filtering techniques. It leverages real-world rating data to generate personalized book recommendations. The system uses models like SVD, NMF, CoClustering, and ALS (Alternating Least Squares) to train on user-book interactions, evaluate their performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R² Score, and ultimately recommend top-rated books.

🔍 Features
📖 Recommends books based on user preferences and ratings

Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)

Co-Clustering

Alternating Least Squares (ALS)

🧪 Evaluation using RMSE, MAE, and R² Score

📈 Visualizations to compare model performances

📚 Title-based book search and recommendations

📱 Clean and minimal mobile app UI design for:
